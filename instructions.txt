To check for all globally installed packages and its dependencies, 
run the npm list command followed by the -g flag.

  > npm list -g

This above command prints the all globally installed packages in tree view.


To view the globally installed packages, without their dependencies use:

    > npm list -g --depth=0

You can also check if a specific package is installed globally or 
not using the npm list -g followed by package name.

  > npm list -g express

Checking locally installed packages
  > npm list
  > npm list --depth=0
  > npm list react
